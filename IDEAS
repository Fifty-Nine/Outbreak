Engine improvements
 * Efficiency improvements 
   - Searching for entities nearby is slow
   - Interactions between entities could probably be sped up, but 
     likely isn't a bottleneck.
   - GUI drawing seems to be slow with lots of entities on screen.
   - Improved concurrency -- currently we only use two(?) threads.
     Given the embarassingly parallel nature of our entities, this is 
     a no-brainer.

 * Asexual reproduction
   - Could implement infected human mechanic or bacteria simulation.

Zombies vs. Humans ideas
 * Zombie horde behavior
   - Like flocking behavior?
   - If nearby human, chase, or if nearby pursuing zombie, follow.

 * Infection mechanics
   - Zombie bites human but human kills zombie. Human becomes infected
     and later becomes a zombie.
   - Would make zombies spread in a less uniform fashion.
   - Would probably still have the standard 
     "one zombie + one human = two zombies" mechanic.

New simulations
  * Genetic algorithms for entity decision making?
    - Could lead to neat emergent behavior.

  * Externally scripted entities
    - Probably not very useful but should be easy with boost::python and
      whatnot.

  * Competitive simulation
    - Along with externally scripted entities, we could create a competitive 
      arena-type sim where multiple scripted entity types compete for resources.
